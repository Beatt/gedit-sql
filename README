Extend the existing sql.lang file to support more Oracle keywords

==Installation Instructions ==

Assumption: 

* Applied system wide (and have admin priviliges)
* Running a debian based system (have not tested on others)
* Updating GtkSourceView 3.0+ (for 2.0+ simply replace 3.0 with 2.0 where necessary)
* Working in the directory where the files are located

===Update Mime Type===

Copy the file sql.xml into either /usr/share/mime/packages (or ~/.local/share/mime/packages.)

sudo cp sql.xml /usr/share/mime/packages/

Then update the mime type database, pointing to the mime folder you copied it to:

sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime/

===Update the lang file===

Make a backup of the original

sudo cp /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/sql.lang /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/sql.lang.backup1

Then plug-in the new file:

sudo cp sql.lang /usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/
